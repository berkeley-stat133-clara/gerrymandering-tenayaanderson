Hi,
I did not give myself enough time to complete this project, and I am running into some kind of error when pushing what I have that I do not understand how to fix. 
I pasted my code into the .qmd files but I am not able to render any pdfs. I will come to office hours and try to figure out how to correctly complete this project,
I genuinely am interested in it and think it is totally useful but I didn't start early enough to seek support when I got stuck. I am genuinely so sorry, thank you for
all of your work putting this together!
Tenaya
